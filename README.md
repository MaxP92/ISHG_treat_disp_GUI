GUI in MatLab for treating and displaying the images for I-SHG microscopy

--- Best practices --- 
To run, execute the I_SHG_GUI.m 
A GUI should appear if no errors  
You might open I_SHG_GUI.fig in GUIDE
THe standalone (no GUI) code I_SHG_2.m might also work, but with few variables fixes

The main GUI:

--- Infos ---  
Testing in Windows (7) x64  
MatLab R2017b (worked with R2016a and R2019a) 

--- Needed ---
- MIJI (https://imagej.net/Miji)
- files in "Variety"
 
---- Files -----  
Lots of .m files are called by I_SHG_GUI.m, or by other sub-files
I-SHG_GUI.pdf for a FULL DESCRIPTION of the GUI
